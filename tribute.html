       <p><span class="spn" >S</span>rinivasa Ramanujan was a self-taught Indian mathematical genius who made numerous contributions in several mathematical fields including mathematical analysis, infinite series, continued fractions, number theory and game theory. Ramanujan provided solutions to mathematical problems that were then considered unsolvable. Moreover, some of his work was so ahead of his time that mathematicians are still understanding its relevance. In 1914, Ramanujan found a formula for computing π (pi) that is currently the basis for the fastest algorithms used to calculate π. The circle method, which he developed with G. H. Hardy, constitute a large area of current mathematical research. Moreover, Ramanujan discovered K3 surfaces which play key roles today in string theory and quantum physics; while his mock modular forms are being used in an effort to unlock the secret of black holes.</p><br>
       <p><span class="spn" >I</span>n recreational mathematics, a magic square of order n is an arrangement of n2 numbers, usually distinct integers, in a square, such that the n numbers in all rows, all columns, and both diagonals sum to the same constant. A normal magic square contains the integers from 1 to n2. The term “magic square” is also sometimes used to refer to any of various types of word square. Below we present to you an unique magic square contributed by Mr. T. R. Jothilingam and his sons. He is a Station Master in Southern Railways, in Kudal Nagar, Madurai, in South India. He graduated in Maths in 1974. He also maintains the website Jolly Maths, which has many such interesting things.</p>
